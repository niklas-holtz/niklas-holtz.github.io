title: "Retrosynthesis with Transformer"
desc: "This project is part of my master thesis and provides a transformer model that can be used for the retrosynthesis of biochemical molecules.  The principles of neural language processing are thus used here to learn the structure of molecules in order to determine their basic substances. The project includes different models and techniques and finally achieves very good results. In addition, a fully automated tool is included, with which all the basic substances of a molecule can be calculated in a purely computer-controlled way."
