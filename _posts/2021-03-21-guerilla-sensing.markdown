title: "Guerilla Sensing"
desc: "The student project \"Guerilla Sensing Oldenburg and Beyond\" offers an online platform with which various environmental parameters in the region around Oldenburg can be viewed and analysed using AI methods. In addition, interested parties can configure their own measuring stations, whereby their firmware is automatically generated by the platform to suit the selected sensors. The project is the result of a one-year development process, the source code of which is publicly available and the platform is still being maintained."
