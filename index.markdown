# Hello!
I am Niklas Holtz, a Master's graduate from the University of Oldenburg. I studied computer science with a specialisation in "Artificial Intelligence" and wrote a master's thesis on the topic of "Retrosynthesis with Transformers". Although I primarily researched AI techniques, I am also a skilled software developer in numerous fields.

This page collects a few of the projects I worked on during my studies. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about any of the projects.
